                <h1>Who is The Batman?</h1>
                <p>Batman is a DC Comics superhero created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, first appearing in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. His true identity is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist and owner of Wayne Enterprises. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, in a Gotham City alley, a traumatic event that shaped his lifelong mission to fight crime. Vowing to rid the city of corruption and injustice, he dedicated years to intense physical and intellectual training, mastering martial arts, detective work, and various sciences. Unlike many superheroes, Batman has no superpowers, relying instead on his intellect, combat skills, and an arsenal of advanced gadgets.
                    Operating from the Batcave beneath Wayne Manor, he fights crime in Gotham City, a metropolis overrun with criminals, corrupt officials, and notorious villains like the Joker, Penguin, and Riddler. His unwavering code against killing sets him apart from many vigilantes, as he believes justice must be served without becoming like the criminals he opposes. Over the decades, Batman has evolved through different interpretations, from the campy 1960s TV show to the darker, more serious tones of The Dark Knight Returns and modern films. His sidekicks, including Robin and Batgirl, along with allies like Commissioner Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth, support his mission. As one of the most iconic superheroes in history, Batmanâ€™s legacy continues through comics, films, video games, and TV series, proving that the symbol of the Dark Knight remains timeless.</p>
